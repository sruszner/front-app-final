                        <p class="lead">Regularly voted as tops by the drivers of the world, the Circuit of Spa-Francorchamps is part of the legendary motorsport tracks in the same way as Le Mans, Indianapolis or Monaco. <br /> A regular theatre since 1985 of the F1 Grand Prix of Belgium, this legendary track, a little more than 7 km, the longest in the world championship, well deserves its official status of "the most beautiful circuit in the world". This global label for the Spa loop is rarely disputed and must be due to its undulating profile, to its quick turns, with its famous and unique Raidillon, of course, but also to a natural and majestic setting, in the middle of forests of fir trees in which the noise of the engines resonate

                        <p class="lead">Eau Rouge is mercilessly unforgiving. The escape zones are small; many into the safety barriers. Still, there is no better feeling for a driver than to go flat out through that zone. You expect it on every lap. The famous combination of corners at Spa-Francorchamps is like a trophy to be won at the highest possible speed. <br /> Mastering this key sector requires skill, enormous self-confidence, a great deal of experience and a huge amount of courage. <br /> However, it is also essential to consider the rest of the 7,004-metre circuit. <br /> Spa-Francorchamps is today a real hub of tourist attractions and sporting events</p>
